Folders 00 to 02 are about materials.

Common attributes of a material
===

Although materials may have different classifications, they still have some commonalities. Common attributes are reflected in three aspects: **basic attributes, integrated attributes and advanced attributes**.

### Basic Attributes

These attributes are the most commonly used.With these properties, you can control the opacity of the object, whether it is visible, and how it is referenced (by ID or custom name).

### Integrated Attributes

Each object has a set of fused properties.These properties determine how the object merges with the background.

### Advanced Attributes

In most cases they are not needed.
